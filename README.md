# odin-metal-window

An app that renders using the **Apple Metal API** into the window.

## Building the App with `build.sh`

To build the app using the `build.sh` script, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Run the following command to build the app without running it:

```bash
./build.sh
```

This command will execute the `build.sh` script and initiate the build process. However, it will not run the app. If you want to run the app after building it, use the command `./build.sh run`.

4. Wait for the build process to complete. Any errors or warnings will be displayed in the terminal.
